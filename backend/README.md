# BACKEND

- The server handles logic for users and their work schedule.
- Every route is documented in code.
- There are routes to get users, add user and get schedule for the next 'X' days.

### The algorithm that decides who works, when, is the 'schedule' inside 'loopers' folder. It iterates every 14 days and assigns people to half days work randomly. Also, better documented with comments.
